# Chris Beckenbach's .dotfiles

This repository consists of the .dotfiles that I use to configure my MacBook builds.

## Insallation

<code>git clone</code> the repository to the ~/.dotfiles directory. 

### Symlinks

Run the ~/.dotfiles/init/symlinks command. It accepts one option, <code>-l</code> or <code>--location</code>. This currently can be either <code>home</code> or <code>work</code>, and will link some different configuration files in for these different locations.
